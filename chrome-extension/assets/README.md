# Icons Required for Chrome Extension

You need to create the following icon files and place them in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often require this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Design Tips:

1. **Simple and Clear**: The icon should be recognizable even at 16x16 pixels
2. **Consistent Style**: Use the same design elements across all sizes
3. **High Contrast**: Ensure the icon stands out against different backgrounds
4. **BS Meter Theme**: Consider using gauge/meter imagery to represent the BS detection functionality

## Temporary Solution:

Until you create custom icons, you can:
1. Use any PNG images and rename them to the required names
2. Generate simple icons using online tools like:
   - favicon.io
   - canva.com
   - figma.com

## Suggested Icon Concept:

A circular gauge or meter with a needle, similar to your app's main visual element. You could use:
- Red zone for "BS" 
- Green zone for "Truth"
- A needle pointing to indicate measurement
- Simple, bold design that scales well
